Simulation of "RISC-V" esque code.

NOT PERFECT COPY OR RISC-V SPECIFICATION.

Although similar, I made various ease-of-life changes.

There is a simulated stack, however there is no implemented heap so far.

There is no displacement operator yet, for example:

	lw		a0 (0)sp

is not supported yet.

Preprocessor commands are not supported.

Labels use:
	$main
notation instead of:
	main:
notation.


sw stores into arg1 instead of into arg2

...
